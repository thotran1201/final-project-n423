For this final project, I created this website called "Fashion Police Blog." It's a website that you can read jokes or write-up comments by the hilarious top cops or Fashion Police on celebrities' worst dressed from 2009-2022. There is also a "thinking game" page where you can upload 9 photos of celebrities' worst dressed and guess who is the ugliest and who is not the ugliest.

To develop the website, I used:

- HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, and CRUD application
- Specifically, on the CRUD application, what I did using CRUD is the "thinking game" page. In there, you can upload 9 pictures of celebrities' worst dressed from the "upload" page (CREATE) and look at those 9 photos of celebrities' worst dressed to see who is the worst. The first photo you think is the ugliest while the last is the less ugliest (READ). If you don't think one of the 9 photos you think is the worst, then you click on the photo and that photo you clicked deletes (DELETE). But, if you want to find a new photo and who you think it's the worst, then you can update the photo by uploading the new celebrities' worst dressed photo (UPDATE). Even though I used CRUD application on the "thinking game" page or "thinking", I utilized local storage instead of Firebase. My professor helped me on connecting the firebase to the project and it went unsucessful with crashes and glitches. So, I decided I am using local storage.
- On the index page, there is a drop-down menu that you can hover over. It shows all the dates of worst dressed celebrities. I used html for a hover button.
- When it comes to weird structures that feels not in place on the worst dressed pages, I always used margin-right, but sometimes I utilize padding-left, padding-right and margin-left.
